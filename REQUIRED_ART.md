# Required Art

The game environment is tile based with a tile size of 20x20.
Most art should look cute/friendly and somewhat colorful (green/orange) while enemies should probably be mostly black/blue.

## Environment

- statue of a goddess: something like [this] featuring a [shrine maiden] as a figure instead. As this statue can get destroyed, it also requires an animation and a destroyed state. (~25x45)
